# Appendix C. Glossary of Terms, Acronyms, and Notations {#s-c}

_This appendix is informative._ It describes the vocabulary and textual representations used in the document.

## C.1 Glossary of Terms {#s-c-1}

The following terms are used throughout this Standard.

Access Control
: The process of granting or denying specific requests to 1) obtain and use information and
related information processing services and 2) enter specific physical facilities (e.g., federal buildings,
military establishments, border crossing entrances).

Adjudicative Entity
: An agency authorized by law, Executive Order, designation by the Security Executive Agent, or delegation by the Suitability & Credentialing Executive Agent to make an adjudication. Adjudication has the meaning provided in [[Executive Order 13764]](references.md#ref-EO-13764), "(a) 'Adjudication' means the evaluation of pertinent data in a background investigation, as well as any other available information that is relevant and reliable, to determine whether a covered individual is: (i) suitable for Government employment; (ii) eligible for logical and physical access; (iii) eligible for access to classified information; (iv) eligible to hold a sensitive position; or (v) fit to perform work for or on behalf of the Government as a Federal employee, contractor, or non-appropriated fund employee."

Applicant
: An individual applying for a _PIV Card_ or _derived PIV credential_. The applicant may be a current or
prospective federal hire, a federal employee, or a contractor.

Application
: A hardware/software system implemented to satisfy a particular set of requirements. In
this context, an application incorporates a system used to satisfy a subset of requirements related to the
verification or identification of an end user's _identity_ so that the end user's _identifier_ can be used to
facilitate the end user's interaction with the system.

Architecture
: A highly structured specification of an acceptable approach within a framework for
solving a specific problem. An architecture contains descriptions of all the _components_ of a selected,
acceptable solution while allowing certain details of specific _components_ to be variable to satisfy related
constraints (e.g., costs, local environment, user acceptability).

Assertion
: A verifiable statement from an IdP to an RP that contains information about an end user. 
Assertions may also contain information about the end user's _authentication_ event at the IdP.

Asymmetric Keys
: Two related _keys_&mdash;a _public key_ and a _private key_&mdash;that are used to perform
complementary operations, such as encryption and decryption or signature generation and signature
verification.

Authentication
: The process of establishing confidence of authenticity; in this case, the validity of a
person's _identity_ and an authenticator (e.g., _PIV Card_ or _derived PIV credential_).

Authenticator
: Something the cardholder possesses and controls (e.g., _PIV Card_ or _derived PIV credential_) that is used to authenticate the cardholderâ€™s identity.

record_ read from the _cardholder_'s activated _PIV Card_. In _BIO_, the biometric
sample may be captured from the _cardholder_ in isolation, while in _BIO-A_, an
attendant must oversee the process of biometric _capture_.

Biometric Capture Device

to a captured biometric sample. [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37)

Biometric Characteristic
: Biological attribute of an individual from which 
distinctive and repeatable values can be extracted for the purpose 
of automated recognition. Fingerprint ridge structure and face topography are 
examples of biometric characteristics [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37).

Biometric Data
: Biometric sample or aggregation of biometric samples at any stage of 
processing [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37).

Biometric Data Record
: Electronic data record containing biometric data.

can be in terms of raw or compressed pixels or in terms of some _biometric characteristic_ (e.g., patterns) [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37).

unique _identifier_ with that _identity_, and collecting and recording the person's relevant attributes into the
system. In some other NIST documents, such as [[SP 800-63A]](references.md#ref-SP-800-63A), identity registration is referred to as _enrollment_.

Identity Verification

comparing the _credentials_ of a person
requesting access with those previously proven and associated with the _PIV Card_ or a _derived PIV credential_ associated with
the _identity_ being claimed.

Invalidate

    defined for digital signatures.
- Specific terms in **CAPITALS** represent normative requirements. When these same terms are not in **CAPITALS**, the term does not represent a normative requirement. 
    - The terms "**SHALL**" and "**SHALL NOT**" indicate requirements to be followed strictly in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is permitted.
    - The terms "**SHOULD**" and "**SHOULD NOT**" indicate that among several possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning or excluding others, that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.
    - The terms "**MAY**" and "**NEED NOT**" indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the publication.
    - The terms "**CAN**" and "**CANNOT**" indicate a possibility and capability&mdash;whether material, physical, or causal&mdash;or, in the negative, the absence of that possibility or capability.
