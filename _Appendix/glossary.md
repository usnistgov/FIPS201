# Appendix C. Glossary of Terms, Acronyms, and Notations {#s-c}

_This appendix is informative._ It describes the vocabulary and textual representations used in the document.

## C.1 Glossary of Terms {#s-c-1}

The following terms are used throughout this Standard.

Access Control
: The process of granting or denying specific requests: 1) obtain and use information and
related information processing services; and 2) enter specific physical facilities (e.g., federal buildings,
military establishments, border crossing entrances).

Applicant
: An individual applying for a _PIV Card_/_credential_. The applicant may be a current or
prospective federal hire, a federal employee, or a contractor.[^eligibility]

Application
: A hardware/software system implemented to satisfy a particular set of requirements. In
this context, an application incorporates a system used to satisfy a subset of requirements related to the
verification or identification of an end user's _identity_ so that the end user's _identifier_ can be used to
facilitate the end user's interaction with the system.

Architecture
: A highly structured specification of an acceptable approach within a framework for
solving a specific problem. An architecture contains descriptions of all the _components_ of a selected,
acceptable solution while allowing certain details of specific _components_ to be variable to satisfy related
constraints (e.g., costs, local environment, user acceptability).

Assertion
: A verifiable statement from an IdP to an RP that contains information about an end user. 
Assertions may also contain information about the end user's _authentication_ event at the IdP.

Asymmetric Keys
: Two related _keys_, a _public key_ and a _private key_, that are used to perform
complementary operations, such as encryption and decryption or signature generation and signature
verification.

Authentication
: The process of establishing confidence of authenticity; in this case, in the validity of a
person's _identity_ and the _PIV Card_.

Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL)
: A measure of the strength of an _authentication_ mechanism, and therefore the confidence in it, as
defined in [[SP 800-63]](references.md#ref-SP-800-63) in terms of three levels:

  - AAL1: SOME confidence
  - AAL2: HIGH confidence

Biometric Authentication (BIO, BIO-A)
: A form of _authentication_ in which authenticity is established by _biometric
verification_ of a new _biometric sample_ from a _cardholder_ to a _biometric data
record_ read from the _cardholder_'s activated _PIV Card_. In _BIO_, the biometric
sample may be captured from the _cardholder_ in isolation, while in _BIO-A_, an
attendant must oversee the process of biometric _capture_.

Biometric Capture Device

to a captured biometric sample [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37).

Biometric Characteristic
: Biological attribute of an individual from which 
distinctive and repeatable values can be extracted for the purpose 
of automated recognition. Fingerprint ridge structure and face topography are 
examples of biometric characteristics. See [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37) for more details.

the same biometric source based on _comparison_ score(s) during a _biometric verification_ 
transaction [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37).

Capture

documents) to establish an _identity_.

Identity Management System (IDMS)
: One or more systems
or _applications_ that manage the _identity proofing_, _registration_, and issuance processes.

Identity Registration
: The process of making a person's _identity_ known to the PIV system, associating a
unique _identifier_ with that _identity_, and collecting and recording the person's relevant attributes into the
system. In some other NIST documents such as [[SP 800-63A]](references.md#ref-SP-800-63A), identity registration is referred to as _enrollment_.

Identity Verification
: The process of confirming or denying that a claimed _identity_ is correct by

requesting access with those previously proven and stored in the _PIV Card_ or system and associated with
the _identity_ being claimed.

Issuer
: The organization that is issuing the _PIV Card_ to an _applicant_. Typically this is an organization
for which the _applicant_ is working.

Issuing Facility
: A physical site or location---including all equipment, staff, and
  documentation---that is responsible for carrying out one or more of the
  following PIV functions:
  
  * _identity proofing_/_registration_;
  * card/token production;
  * activation/issuance; and
  * maintenance.

Key
: See _Cryptographic Key_.

Match
: _Comparison_ decision stating that the biometric probe(s) and the biometric 
reference are from the same source. Match is a possible result of a 
_Comparison_. The opposite of a match is a non-match. See [[ISO 2382-37]](references.md#ref-ISO/IEC-2382-37) for more details.

: Refers to data that is stored within the _PIV Card_ or to a computation that is performed by the
Integrated Circuit Chip (ICC) of the _PIV Card_.

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
: An online protocol used to determine the status of a _public
key_ certificate [[RFC 6960]](references.md#ref-RFC6960).

Path Validation
: The process of verifying the binding between the subject _identifier_ and subject _public
key_ in a certificate, based on the _public key_ of a trust anchor, through the validation of a chain of
certificates that begins with a certificate issued by the trust anchor and ends with the target certificate.
Successful path validation provides strong evidence that the information in the target certificate is
trustworthy.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

individual's _identity_, such as name, social security number, _biometric data records_, etc. alone, or when
combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual,

to an individual that contains a PIV Card Application which stores _identity_ _credentials_ (e.g., photograph,
_cryptographic keys_, digitized fingerprint representation) so that the claimed _identity_ of the _cardholder_ can

encrypt data.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## C.3 Notations {#s-c-3}

This Standard uses the following typographical conventions in text:

- ASN.1 data types are represented in a `monospaced font`. For example, `SignedData` and `SignerInfo` are data types
    defined for digital signatures.
- Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same terms are not in CAPITALS, the term does not represent a normative requirement. 
    - The terms "SHALL" and "SHALL NOT" indicate requirements to be followed strictly in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is permitted.
    - The terms "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" indicate that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.
    - The terms "MAY" and "NEED NOT" indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the publication.
    - The terms "CAN" and "CANNOT" indicate a possibility and capability, whether material, physical or causal or, in the negative, the absence of that possibility or capability.
