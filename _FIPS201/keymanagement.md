# 5. PIV Key Management Requirements {#s-5}

_This section is normative._ It defines the processes and components required for managing a PIV Cardâ€™s lifecycle and provides the requirements and specifications related to key management.

PIV Cards consistent with this specification **SHALL** have two or more asymmetric private keys. To manage
the public keys associated with the asymmetric private keys, departments and agencies **SHALL** issue and
manage X.509 public key certificates as specified in this section.

## 5.1 Architecture {#s-5-1}

CAs that issue certificates to support PIV private keys **SHALL** participate in the hierarchical PKI
for the Common Policy managed by the Federal PKI. 

CA certificates **SHALL** conform to
[[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON).

## 5.2 PKI Certificate {#s-5-2}

All certificates issued to support PIV private keys (i.e., PIV authentication, card authentication, digital signature, and key management certificates) **SHALL** be issued in accordance with [[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON). 
CAs and registration authorities can either be operated by departments and agencies or be outsourced to PKI
service providers. For a list of PKI service providers that have been approved to operate under
[[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON), see <https://www.idmanagement.gov>.

Details of the cryptographic properties of PIV keys are found in [Section 4.2.2](frontend.md#s-4-2-2) and its subsections.

### 5.2.1 X.509 Certificate Contents {#s-5-2-1}

The required contents of X.509 certificates associated with PIV private keys are based on [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF). The
relationship is described below:

- Certificates that contain the public key associated with a PIV authentication private key **SHALL** conform
    to the *PIV Authentication Certificate Profile* in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF) and **SHALL** specify the `id-fpki-common-authentication` policy of [[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON) in the certificate policies extension
    ([Section 4.2.2.1](frontend.md#s-4-2-2-1)).
- Certificates that contain the public key associated with an asymmetric card authentication private key
    **SHALL** conform to the *Card Authentication Certificate Profile* in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF) and **SHALL** specify the `id-fpki-common-cardAuth` policy of [[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON) in the certificate policies extension
    ([Section 4.2.2.2](frontend.md#s-4-2-2-2)).
- Certificates that contain the public key associated with a digital signature private key **SHALL** conform to the
    *End Entity Signature Certificate Profile* in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF) and **SHALL** specify the `id-fpki-common-hardware` policy of [[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON) in the certificate policies
    extension ([Section 4.2.2.4](frontend.md#s-4-2-2-4)).
- Certificates containing the public key associated with a key management private key **SHALL** conform to
    *Key Management Certificate Profile* in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF) and **SHALL** specify the `id-fpki-common-policy` or `id-fpki-common-hardware` policy of [[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON) in the certificate policies extension
    ([Section 4.2.2.5](frontend.md#s-4-2-2-5)).
- Requirements for algorithms and key sizes for each type of PIV asymmetric key are given in
    [[SP 800-78]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-SP-800-78).

The expiration date of the PIV authentication and card authentication certificates 
**SHALL NOT** be after the expiration date of the PIV Card. 
The expiration date of the PIV card is printed on the card in Zone 14F (see [Section 4.1.4](#s-4-1-4)) and is contained in the CHUID data object (see [Section 4.2.1](#s-4-2-1)). 
If the card is revoked, 
the PIV authentication and card authentication certificates **SHALL** be revoked in cases where the card cannot be collected and destroyed.
However, a PIV authentication or card authentication certificate **MAY** be revoked and subsequently replaced without revoking the
PIV Card. The presence of a valid, unexpired, and unrevoked authentication
certificate on a card is sufficient proof that the card was issued and is not revoked.

## 5.3 X.509 Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Contents {#s-5-3}
{:latex-toc="5.3 X.509 Certificate Revocation List Contents"}

CAs that issue certificates corresponding to PIV private keys **SHALL** issue CRLs as specified in
[[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON). The contents of X.509 CRLs **SHALL** conform to *CRL Profile* in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF).

## 5.4 Legacy PKIs (Removed) {#s-5-4}
{:latex-toc="5.4 Legacy PKIs"}

The content of this section has been removed since [[COMMON]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-COMMON) provides the requirements for department and agency CAs that might be issuing cross-certified PIV authentication certificates and card authentication certificates.

## 5.5 PKI Repository and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Responders {#s-5-5}
{:latex-toc="5.5 PKI Repository and Online Certificate Status Protocol Responders"}

CAs that issue certificates corresponding to PIV private keys (i.e., PIV authentication, card authentication, digital signature, or key management certificates) **SHALL**

- maintain a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) accessible service that publishes the CRLs for the PIV certificates that it issues, as specified in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF);
- maintain an HTTP-accessible service that publishes any CA certificates issued to it, as specified in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF); and
- operate Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP, specified in [[RFC 6960]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-RFC6960)) services for the PIV certificates that it issues, as specified in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF).

PIV authentication, card authentication, digital signature, and key management certificates **SHALL**

- contain the `crlDistributionPoints` extension needed to locate CRLs, and
- contain the `authorityInfoAccess` extension needed to locate the authoritative OCSP responder.

Departments and agencies **SHALL** notify CAs when certificates need to be revoked.

### 5.5.1 Certificate and CRL Distribution {#s-5-5-1}

This Standard requires the distribution of CA certificates and CRLs using HTTP. Specific requirements are
found in [[PROF]](../_Appendix/references.md#ref-PROF).

Certificates that contain the FASC-N or card UUID in the SAN extension, such as PIV
authentication certificates and card authentication certificates, **SHALL NOT** be distributed publicly (e.g., via
HTTP accessible from the public internet).
Individual departments and agencies can decide whether digital signature and key
management certificates can be distributed publicly by the CA.

### 5.5.2 OCSP Status Responders {#s-5-5-2}

OCSP status responders **SHALL** be implemented as a certificate status
mechanism. The OCSP status responders **SHALL** be updated at least as frequently as CRLs are issued.
