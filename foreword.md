# Federal Information Processing Standards 201 2013

## Announcing the Standard for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.

# 1. Name of Standard.

FIPS PUB 201-2: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors.[^hspd12]

[^hspd12]: This Standard is in response to Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, which states that it is “intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch of the Federal Government.”


# 2. Category of Standard.

Information Security.

# 3. Explanation.

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 [HSPD-12], dated August 27, 2004, entitled “Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors,” directed the promulgation of a Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractors. It further specified secure and reliable identification that—

+ (a) is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual employee’s identity;
+ (b) is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist exploitation;
+ (c) can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
+ (d) is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official accreditation process.
 
The directive stipulated that the Standard include graduated criteria, from least secure to most secure, to ensure flexibility in selecting the appropriate level of security for each application. Executive departments and agencies are required to implement the Standard for identification issued to Federal employees and contractors in gaining physical access to controlled facilities and logical access to controlled information systems.

# 4. Approving Authority.

Secretary of Commerce.

# 5. Maintenance Agency.

Department of Commerce, NIST, Information Technology Laboratory (ITL).

# 6. Applicability.

This Standard is applicable to identification issued by Federal departments and agencies to Federal employees and contractors (including contractor employees) for gaining physical access to Federally controlled facilities and logical access to Federally controlled information systems, except for “national security systems” as defined by 44 U.S.C. 3542(b)(2) [SP 800-59]. Except as provided in [HSPD-12], nothing in this Standard alters the ability of government entities to use the Standard for additional applications.

Special-Risk Security Provision—The U.S. Government has personnel, facilities, and other assets deployed and operating worldwide under a vast range of threats (e.g., terrorist, technical, intelligence), particularly heightened overseas. For cardholders with particularly sensitive threats while outside the contiguous United States, the issuance, holding, and/or use of PIV Cards with full technical capabilities as described herein may result in unacceptably high risk. In such cases of extant risk (e.g., to facilities, individuals, operations, the national interest, or the national security), by the presence and/or use of full- capability PIV Cards, the head of a department or independent agency MAY issue a select number of maximum security PIV Cards that do not contain (or otherwise do not fully support) the wireless and/or biometric capabilities otherwise required/referenced herein. To the greatest extent practicable, heads of departments and independent agencies SHOULD minimize the issuance of such special-risk security PIV Cards so as to support interagency interoperability and the President’s policy. Use of other risk- mitigating technical (e.g., high-assurance on-off switches for the wireless capability) and procedural mechanisms in such situations is preferable, and as such is also explicitly permitted and encouraged. As protective security technology advances, the need for this provision will be re-assessed as the Standard undergoes the normal review and update process.

# 7. Specifications.

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 201 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors.

# 8. Implementations.

This Standard satisfies the control objectives, security requirements, and technical interoperability requirements of [HSPD-12]. The Standard specifies implementation of identity credentials on integrated circuit cards for use in a Federal personal identity verification system.

A PIV Card must be personalized with identity information for the individual to whom the card is issued, in order to perform identity verification by automated systems. Humans can use the physical card for visual comparisons, whereas automated systems can use the electronically stored data on the card to conduct automated identity verification. In implementing PIV systems and pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act), as amended, agencies have the responsibility to accommodate federal employees and contractors with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data comparable to the access to and use of such information and data by federal employees and contractors who are not individuals with disabilities. In instances where Federal agencies assert exceptions to Section 508 accessibility requirements (e.g., undue burden, national security, commercial non-availability), Sections 501 and 504 of the Act requires Federal agencies to provide reasonable accommodation for federal employees and contractors with disabilities whose needs are not met by the baseline accessibility provided under Section 508. While Section 508 compliance is the responsibility of Federal agencies and departments, this Standard specifies options to aid in implementation of the requirements:

+ Section 4.1.4.3 specifies Zones 21F and 22F as an option for orientation markers of the PIV Card.
+ Section 2.8 describes an alternative to the National Criminal History Check (NCHC) in instances where an applicant has unclassifiable fingerprints.
+ Sections 2.8, and 2.9 specify alternative methods for the 1:1 biometric match required at PIV Card issuance, reissuance, and reset.
+ Section 6 defines authentication mechanisms with varying characteristics for both physical and logical access (e.g., with or without PIN, over contact, contactless, or virtual contact interface).

Federal departments and agencies must use accredited issuers to issue identity credentials for Federal employees and contractors. For this purpose, NIST provided guidelines for the accreditation of PIV Card issuers in [SP 800-79]. The Standard also covers security and interoperability requirements for PIV Cards. For this purpose, NIST has established the PIV Validation Program that tests implementations for conformance with this Standard as specified in [SP 800-73] and [SP 800-78]. Additional information on this program is published and maintained at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has set up the FIPS 201 Evaluation Program to evaluate conformance of different families of products that support the PIV processes of this Standard – see Appendix A.5.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides implementation oversight for this Standard. The respective numbers of agency-issued 1) general PIV Cards and 2) special-risk PIV Cards (issued under the Special-Risk Security Provision) are subject to annual reporting to the OMB under the annual reporting process in a manner prescribed by OMB.

# 9. Effective Date.

This Standard is effective immediately and supersedes FIPS 201-1 (Change Notice 1). New optional features of this Standard that depend upon the release of new or revised NIST Special Publications are effective upon final publication of the supporting Special Publications.

# 10. Implementation Schedule.

This Standard mandates the implementation of some PIV Card features that were optional to implement in FIPS 201-1. To comply with FIPS 201-2, all new and replacement PIV Cards SHALL be issued with the mandatory PIV Card features no later than 12 months after the effective date of this Standard.

Accreditations of PIV Card issuers (PCIs) that occur 12 months after the effective date of this Standard SHALL be in compliance with 
FIPS 201-2.

FIPS 201-2 compliance of PIV components and subsystems is provided in accordance with M-06-18 [OMB0618] and M-11-11 [OMB1111] through products and services from GSA’s Interoperability Test Program and Approved Products and Services List, once available. Implementation Guidance to PIV enable federal facilities and information systems, in accordance to M-11-11 will be outlined in the “Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Roadmap and Implementation Guidance.”

# 11. Qualifications.

The security provided by the PIV system is dependent on many factors outside the scope of this Standard. Upon adopting this Standard, organizations must be aware that the overall security of the personal identification system relies on—

+ assurance provided by the issuer of an identity credential that the individual in possession of the credential has been correctly identified;
+ protection provided to an identity credential stored within the PIV Card and transmitted between the card and the PIV issuance and usage infrastructure; and
+ protection provided to the identity verification system infrastructure and components throughout the entire lifecycle.

Although it is the intent of this Standard to specify mechanisms and support systems that provide high assurance personal identity verification, conformance to this Standard does not assure that a particular implementation is secure. It is the implementer’s responsibility to ensure that components, interfaces, communications, storage media, managerial processes, and services used within the identity verification system are designed and built in a secure manner.

Similarly, the use of a product that conforms to this Standard does not guarantee the security of the overall system in which the product is used. The responsible authority in each department and agency SHALL ensure that an overall system provides the acceptable level of security.

Because a standard of this nature must be flexible enough to adapt to advancements and innovations in science and technology, NIST has a policy to review this Standard within five years to assess its adequacy.

# 12. Waivers.

As per the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 [FISMA], waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards are not allowed.

# 13. Where to Obtain Copies.
